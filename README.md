## A password manager for CPSC 210

This project was inspired by the increasing number of compromised passwords on my personal accounts. With many 
companies looking to make profit from their password managers, finding the right password manager that offers all the
tools necessary to secure your account, without having to pay a monthly fee poses as a challenge. I decided to take 
matters into my own hands and create a password manager that not only stores your passwords, but generates the best 
password for you to ensure that you will never have to experience a compromised account again!

**Design and Aesthetics**<br>
As a frontend developer at heart, I want to ensure that users will have a easy to navigate UI, while keeping aesthetics 
to its highest standards. With the UI libraries that Java offers, I will tinker and design to the best of my abilities.

**What will this application do?**
- Allows users to input their username, password, and website
  - This data is stored and can be retrieved on-demand
- Users can input a length for their password, and disable certain characters from 
    being generated
  - Users will then be told if the password is strong, medium, or weak
- Displays user's passwords in UI
- Users can search for the password they want to retrieve

**Who will use it?**<br/>
Anybody who wants to keep their passwords safe and secure, those who use the same password for all of their accounts,
or those who are tired of having their accounts compromised!
