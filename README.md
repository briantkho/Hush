# Flappy Birb
## An endless runner game inspired by "Flappy Bird" for CPSC 210

This project was inspired by the infamous "Flappy Bird" game, released in 2013. Since its removal from all
mobile stores, I have been craving the nostalgia and joy that this game brought me as a child. This term project gives
me the perfect opportunity to rekindle that spark and relive the experiences from years back. 
I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do!

**Design and Aesthetics**<br>
This version will be "reskinned" into the much loved UBC Birb
- Your character will be "Birb"
- Obstacles are UBC students and Pencils

**What will this application do?**
- The objective is for the Birb to pass through approaching obstacles 
  - Obstacles are approaching at an increasing rate
- Score will be incremented by 1 after each obstacle passed
  - Scores are unlimited
- You will lose the game when you hit the bottom of the screen or an obstacle
- Score will reset to 0 after each game ends
- Clicks will move Birb by a set amount
- Leaving the screen unclicked will drop Birb

**Who will use it?**<br/>
Anybody who wants to relive the excitement of achieve a new high score in Flappy Bird, or anybody who would like to 
review my work evaluate my progress!
